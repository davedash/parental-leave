    Company: Vayner Media
    Paternity: 0
    Maternity: 12
    Source: VaynerMedia employee
    Notes: Because of vaynermedia's "unlimited vacation" policy, no paternity leave is allotted.  I will soon learn how much time this actually nets out to, but it has been frustrating for me to be told that there is no policy because there is no need for one.  For maternity leave, I believe 12 weeks is the upper end of the spectrum, but 8 might be more normal.
