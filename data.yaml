    Company: Vayner Media
    Paternity: 0
    Maternity: 12
    Source: VaynerMedia employee
    Notes: Because of vaynermedia's "unlimited vacation" policy, no paternity leave is allotted.  I will soon learn how much time this actually nets out to, but it has been frustrating for me to be told that there is no policy because there is no need for one.  For maternity leave, I believe 12 weeks is the upper end of the spectrum, but 8 might be more normal.

    Notes: "STD policy provides 6 weeks paid at 60% with a 15-day waiting period, and the waiting period cuts into this time, so in actuality, it's not quite 4 weeks. Additionally, you must exhaust all accrued PTO before you can collect any STD. If eligible, FMLA protects your job for 12 weeks, and they do not let you take a day more of unpaid leave. You do not accrue PTO while on leave, but you do accrue PTO for the month you return, regardless of when in the month you come back. Finally, the company covers your health insurance premiums while you are out and garnish your checks when you return to recoup those expenses. "
